# Dronestream

Android framework for Josh Begley's [metadata](http://metadata.joshbegley.com/) app.

To get this running as intended you'll need to clone the project and then follow two steps: 
-	Go into the MainActivity class and replace the asterisks (****) in the setupViewPager function with the URLs for the feed and mapview.
-	Open the app build.gradle and supply the manifestPlaceholders variable with your onesignal app id and your google project number.
